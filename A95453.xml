         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat your Petitioners, and many other Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> being deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the deſtructive deſigne of ſome, who laboured to foment a new warre, in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty joyned to the number of three thouſand, or thereabouts, in a Petition for peace, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the ſaid City, in Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell Aſſembled, and went unarmed, in a peaceable manner unto the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſame, on the day aboveſaid, and in regard the Court was not ſate, but ſhortly expected (according to appointment) to ſit.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:161214:4"/>
            <p>The Petitioners attended at the Common Councell-doore, and in the Hall, and yard, there to deliver their ſaid Petition into the Court, and had appointed one (or more if occaſion were) to ſpeak thereto: At which time an Alderman comming to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councell doore, laid hands on one of the petitioners, who was ſo appointed to ſpeak, and endevoured by force to pull him to the Committee of the <hi>Militia</hi> there ſitting; thereby to terrifie the petitioners, which not taking effect, the Lord Mayor came to the ſaid doore, and (in a violent manner) did ſtrike and thruſt ſome of the petitioners, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have the petition from them, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to be gone: And when his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip returned back toward the <hi>Militia</hi> doore, preſently after came downe their Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Poyntz,</hi> and divers Reformadoes with him (Major Generall <hi>Maſſey</hi> being gone out before). And the ſaid <hi>Poyntz</hi> with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formadoes, when they came to the lower end of the yard, and had got more of their party together, returned back with drawn ſwords in their hands, and fell upon the Petitioners in the yard, calling them <hi>Independent Dogges,

            <p>And while this cruelty was in acting, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Generall <hi>Maſſey</hi> with a great party more of Reformadoes, came into <hi>Baſsinſhaw-ſtreet,</hi> with their ſwords drawn, where ſome of the Petitioners (who had eſcaped that way from the former violence) w re afreſh aſſaulted by the ſaid <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and a dangerous blow made by himſelf at one of the Petitioners.</p>
